# Tidewave

> Tidewave Web for Django and Flask is currently in alpha testing!

Tidewave is the coding agent for full-stack web app development, deeply integrated with Python web frameworks, from the database to the UI. [See our website](https://tidewave.ai) for more information.

This project can also be used as a standalone Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for your editors.

## Installation

### Django

Add `tidewave[django]` as a dependency to your `pyproject.toml`:

```
"tidewave[django] @ git+https://github.com/tidewave-ai/tidewave_python.git",
```

Then open up your `settings.py` and add the following after your `MIDDLEWARE` and `INSTALLED_APPS` definition:

```python
if DEBUG:
    INSTALLED_APPS.insert(0, "tidewave.django.apps.TidewaveConfig")
    MIDDLEWARE.insert(0, 'tidewave.django.Middleware')
```

If you are using Jinja2, you need to add our extension too (preferably in `DEBUG` mode only):

```python
JINJA2_ENVIRONMENT_OPTIONS = {
    "extensions": [
        "tidewave.jinja2.Extension"
    ],
}
```

Note Tidewave only runs in DEBUG mode.

#### Settings

* `ALLOWED_HOSTS` - Tidewave use the same allowed origins as your app to validate access
* `TIDEWAVE["allow_remote_access"]` - Whether to allow remote connections (default `False`)
* `TIDEWAVE["team"]` - Enable your Tidewave Team configuration, such as `TIDEWAVE = {"team": {"id": "dashbit"}}`

### Flask

Add `tidewave[flask]` as a dependency to your `pyproject.toml`:

```
"tidewave[flask] @ git+https://github.com/tidewave-ai/tidewave_python.git",
```

Now, in your application definition, you can initialize the `Tidewave` class and pass your Flask application to `init_app`:

```python
from tidewave.flask import Tidewave
tidewave = Tidewave()
tidewave.init_app(app)
```

Tidewave will automatically detect if your Flask application is using SQLAlchemy and Jinja2 and configure them automatically.

Note Tidewave only runs when `app.debug` is `True`. Therefore, remember to start your dev server with the `--debug` flag. If you are setting `app.debug` programatically, remember to do so before you call `tidewave.init_app`.

#### Configuration

When initializing `Tidewave()`, the following options are supported:

- `allow_remote_access:` allow remote connections when True (default False)
- `allowed_origins:` list of allowed origin hosts (default [])
- `team`: enable Tidewave Web for teams

### FastAPI

> Tidewave Web is currently not supported for FastAPI.

Add `tidewave[fastapi]` as a dependency to your `pyproject.toml`:

```
"tidewave[fastapi] @ git+https://github.com/tidewave-ai/tidewave_python.git",
```

Now, in your application definition, you can initialize the `Tidewave` class and pass your FastAPI application to `install`:

```python
from tidewave.fastapi import Tidewave
tidewave = Tidewave()
tidewave.install(app)
```

Note Tidewave only runs when `app.debug` is `True`. Therefore, remember to start your dev server with `fastapi dev`. If you are setting `app.debug` programatically, remember to do so before you call `tidewave.install`.

If you are using Jinja2, you need to add our extension too (preferably in `app.debug` mode only):

```python
if app.debug:
    from tidewave.jinja2 import Extension
    templates.env.add_extension(Extension)
```

If you are using SQLAlchemy, then you need to pass your `Base` class and the underlying engine as arguments to install:

```python
tidewave.install(app, sqlalchemy_base=Base, sqlalchemy_engine=engine)
```

#### Configuration

When initializing `Tidewave()`, the following options are supported:

- `allow_remote_access:` allow remote connections when True (default False)
- `allowed_origins:` list of allowed origin hosts (default [])
- `team`: enable Tidewave Web for teams

## Troubleshooting

Tidewave expects your web application to be running on `localhost`. If you are not running on localhost, you may need to enable additional configuration, such as `allow_remote_access`.

Furthermore, Tidewave only runs while in `DEBUG`/`app.debug` mode on all frameworks.

If you want to use Docker for development, you either need to enable the configuration above or automatically redirect the relevant ports, as done by [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). See our [containers](https://hexdocs.pm/tidewave/containers.html) guide for more information.

### Content security policy

If you have enabled Content-Security-Policy, Tidewave will automatically enable "unsafe-eval" under `script-src` in order for contextual browser testing to work correctly. It also disables the `frame-ancestors` directive.
